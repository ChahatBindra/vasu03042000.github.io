Virtual Lab
We contributed to #Vlabs or Virtual Lab (An Initiative of the Ministry of Education Under the National Mission on Education through ICT). 
We did project on "Study of various Networking Devices" in the module of Computer Networks , where one could learn about various networking devices without any prior knowledge.
